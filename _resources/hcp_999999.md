We've been working with HCP cifti files a lot. Now, for any study that requires across subject analyses, we've started preprocessing our 7T data such that we can analyze it in this same format. Specifically, we're aiming at the 59k version of the HCP cifti. 

Let's say you have data in this format, and you've read the surface-data from the cifti `.nii` file. Now you need to visualize it, and the best way to do this is through pycortex. We've made a pycortex subject for the 59k surfaces, so that it becomes easy to visualize data on surface flatmaps. You can download this [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/59k_HCP_subject_entry_for_pycortex_database/13372958). Make sure to save it where pycortex expects it.
