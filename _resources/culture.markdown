## Overall Goal of our Research

Our goal is to produce research outcomes that will still be considered a valid contribution by scientists far into the future. This means that we want to do our science well, not fast. So:
- not cutting corners (*houtje-touwtje* solutions are not solutions but workarounds)
- trying to create things that can be re-used, first by others in the lab, secondarily by others in the wider research community. 
- remaining sensitive to the feeling of not being sure: *Develop and cultivate Spider-Sense*

This notion of not being sure is really important in scientific practice. It will guide you to improve your understanding of important issues and concepts, and is a guiding principle in the improvement of the quality of your work. Even more importantly, this is how you identify true knowledge gaps: if no one has formulated an answer to your question it's a good bet that you've found a valid research question.
