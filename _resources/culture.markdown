## Overall Goal of our Research

Our goal is to produce research outcomes that will still be considered a valid contribution by scientists far into the future. This means that we want to do our science well, not fast. So:
- not cutting corners (*houtje-touwtje* solutions are not solutions but workarounds)
- trying to create things that can be re-used, first by others in the lab, secondarily by others in the wider research community. 
- remaining sensitive to the feeling of not being sure: *Develop and cultivate Spider-Sense*

This notion of not being sure is really important in scientific practice. It will guide you to improve your understanding of important issues and concepts, and is a guiding principle in the improvement of the quality of your work. Even more importantly, this is how you identify true knowledge gaps: if no one has formulated an answer to your question it's a good bet that you've found a valid research question.

## The Lab community

This document is based on Wei Ji Ma's Statement on lab culture and expectations, which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f6foaCkHiCkPKjO0gdKkkdm2dn1EKn5xRKZv-Ut5Dg4/edit?usp=sharing). It describes our lab culture and the expectations we can have of one another in the lab. What's below is mostly a copy of the linked google doc (the example is just that good), but with edits where applicable. 

### Lab culture

We strive for a welcoming space where people can bring their whole selves to work. Everyone in the lab should be kind, respectful, and supportive of each other.
- I see the work we do as collective. In the lab, we never compete with each other, but we try to lift each other up. I also think this is a good attitude in the broader scientific community, but it is sometimes hard to not get carried away by the many competitive elements of scientific careers.
- I expect everyone to participate in the lab’s academic events (lab meeting, interest group meetings, external presentations by lab members) to the best of their ability. Participation is not just attending but also paying attention and in internal events, asking questions and commenting.
- Show interest in and learn about your lab colleagues’ work. This can be done informally, such as stopping by someone’s desk and asking them what they are up to. This will also benefit yourself. 
- I value open and direct communication. Please feel free to disagree with me at any time, and to bring up when you think that things I do are problematic. -->
