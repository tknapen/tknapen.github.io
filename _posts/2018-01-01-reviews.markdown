### Bistable Perception Review
<br />
Randolph Blake, Jan Brascamp and Tomas collaborated with Philipp Sterzer to write what we feel is the next major review article in the field of Bistable Perception. We're very proud to have used our scientific controversy into a productive collaboration, bringing together the *high-level* and *low-level* views on bistable perception in one coherent narratie.

### Population Receptive Field Mapping Review
<br />
Serge Dumoulin and Tomas wrote a review on how the representation of visual information changes as a function of cognitive demands and disorders. This is not the last article from this collaboration at the Spinoza Centre, by far!
