description: Our lab has recently published a couple of papers on pupil responses and fMRI of eye-movement influences on visual cortex.

In the past month, our lab has published a few papers, on diverse topics. 

Firstly, we found that pupil size fluctuations under isoluminance are determined not only by cognitive factors such as arousal, but are very much influenced by ocular events such as blinks and microsaccades. We proposed a few strategies for analyzing these data in this paper: [pupil paper](/publications/2016-05-18-PO). These strategies are implemented in [FIRDeconvolution](/science/fir_deconvolution)

Then, we also published a project started long ago, investigating the remapping of visual information in retinotopic cortex, using fMRI: [oculomotor remapping paper](/publications/2016-06-21-FSN). In short, we found that the brain responses underpinning our visual stability around eye movements relay precise location/shape information to the fovea around the time of eye movements.
