description: Open PhD/postdoc position on CAS/NWO collaboration.
---

Our lab at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam has an opening to be filled by either a PhD student (4 years) or junior PostDoc (2-3 years), financed by an [NWO-CAS grant](http://www.nwo.nl/en/news-and-events/news/2016/nihc/1-5-million-for-sino-dutch-research-in-brain-and-cognition.html).
 
In this project, we will study the interplay between top-down and bottom-up processing in perceptual bistability using functional imaging of cortical laminae at 7T. This project will answer cognitive neuroscience questions from a systems neuroscience perspective. The project involves mathematical modelling of behaviour, detailed psychophysics and eye tracking, as well as the development of state-of-the-art analysis techniques for submillimeter resolution functional imaging. Therefore, the successful applicant will have a background in computation, be a fluent programmer and preferably have experience with high-resolution functional imaging. 

The project is a collaboration with the Zhang lab at the Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing and the He lab at the University of Minnesota, and will involve regular travel between these labs. 

Feel free to contact Tomas Knapen (tknapen@gmail.com) for informal inquiries. More information on bistable perception can be found in our recent review of the topic on [the Annual Reviews of Psychology website](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-psych-010417-085944). The lab website can be found at [tknapen.github.io](http://tknapen.github.io), and we are part of the [cognitive psychology group](http://vupsy.nl) ath the VU.

A formal application should contain a CV, statement of interest and two letters of recommendation, and be sent to barbara.goudriaan@vu.nl, with reference number 00034515. We will entertain applications continuously from now.
