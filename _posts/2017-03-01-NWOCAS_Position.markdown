title:  Open position - High resolution fMRI of bistable perception
date:   2017-03-01 12:00:00
description: Open PhD/postdoc position on CAS/NWO collaboration.
---

Our lab at the [_Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam_](http://vu.nl) has an opening to be filled by either a PhD student (4 years) or junior PostDoc (2-3 years), financed by an [NWO-CAS grant](http://www.nwo.nl/en/news-and-events/news/2016/nihc/1-5-million-for-sino-dutch-research-in-brain-and-cognition.html).
 
_**Outline of research project**_

In this project, we will study the interplay between top-down and bottom-up processing in perceptual bistability using functional imaging of cortical laminae at 7T. This project will answer cognitive neuroscience questions from a systems neuroscience perspective. The project involves mathematical modelling of behaviour, detailed psychophysics and eye tracking, as well as the development of state-of-the-art analysis techniques for submillimeter resolution functional imaging. Therefore, the successful applicant will have a background in computation, be a fluent programmer and preferably have experience with high-resolution functional imaging. 

The project is a collaboration with the Zhang lab at the Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing and the He lab at the University of Minnesota, and will involve regular travel between these labs.
