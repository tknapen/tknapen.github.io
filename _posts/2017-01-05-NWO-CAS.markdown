For an international collaboration between our lab and the Beijing lab of Peng Zhang and Sheng He, we have received â‚¬360000 for a 3-year postdoc or a 4-year PhD position. We will use state-of-the-art high-resolution fMRI and MEG recordings to answer the question how bottom-up and top-down information flows in the brain give rise to our conscious perception, using a paradigm called [Binocular Rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_rivalry).
