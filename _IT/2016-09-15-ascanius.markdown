### Hardware
<br />
Ascanius is a [Xeon Phi DAP system](http://dap.xeonphi.com). It is especially suited for highly parallel data analysis, and the training of neural network models. It's connected to Aeneas via direct a 10GigE connection. 
<br />


### Software
<br />
Ascanius runs Centos 7.2. As with Aeneas, our goal is to provide as much flexibility to the users while expending as little effort as possible. This means that we try to take care of operating system type stuff, and users are expected to take care of their own userland software installations. 

In practice, we have installed daemons etc, but the installation of neuroimaging packages, python toolchains, etc. is left in the hands of the users. 

For specific software installation issues, refer to the specific pages in the [IT section of this website](/IT). 
<br />


### Access
<br />
To connect to Ascanius: [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) from Aeneas. This allows you to run analyses from the terminal. Ascanius can load Aeneas' disks using sshfs, thus operating on the same data as Aeneas [sshfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSHFS). For instructions on how to do this, see the [Aeneas section](/IT/2016-09-14-aeneas/).
