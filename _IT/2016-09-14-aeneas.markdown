### Hardware
<br />
Aeneas houses 2 3.1GHz 8-core Xeon processors with 128 GB of installed memory. There are three disk arrays; the `/` system is a RAID-0 SSD pair, and the `/home` system is a 18TB RAID-5 array of 4 disks. For backup there is a `/home2` file system, a RAID-5 array of 4 disks, with 8 TB in total. For CUDA computations there is an Nvidia Titan X.
<br />


### Software
<br />
Aeneas runs Centos 7.2 minimal install. Our goal is to provide as much flexibility to the users while expending as little effort as possible. This means that we try to take care of operating system type stuff, and users are expected to take care of their own userland software installations. 

In practice, we have installed daemons, CUDA drivers, Xfce4 etc, but the installation of neuroimaging packages, python toolchains, etc. is left in the hands of the users. 

For specific software installation issues, refer to the specific pages in the [IT section of this website](/IT). 
<br />


### Access
<br />
There is one way to connect to Aeneas: [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell). This allows you to run analyses from the terminal, view plotting windows across an X connection, and mount Aeneas' disks using [sshfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSHFS).

#### ssh
<br />
To connect from a UNIX terminal:
`ssh -YC $USER@aeneas.psy.vu.nl`, assuming that your usernames are the same everywhere. If not, fill it in. From Windows, use [putty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PuTTY), but you're on your own. It helps to make an alias of this command: `alias aeneas='ssh -YC $USER@aeneas.psy.vu.nl'`.

#### sshfs
<br />
To mount disks from a UNIX terminal, it helps to create a few aliases. 
These commands can of course also be used outside of the aliases. We mount our user folder on aeneas at `~/disks/Aeneas_Home/`, assuming again that your usernames are the same everywhere.

##### sshfs from Mac OS X

{% highlight bash %}
alias aeneas_home='sshfs -p 22 $USER@aeneas.psy.vu.nl:/home/$USER ~/disks/Aeneas_Home/ \
 -oauto_cache,reconnect,defer_permissions,noappledouble,negative_vncache,volname=home'
{% endhighlight %}

This line can be duplicated for several other folders on the server, most importantly the `/home/shared/` folder, mounted at `~/disks/Aeneas_Shared/`. 

{% highlight bash %}
alias aeneas_shared='sshfs -p 22 $USER@aeneas.psy.vu.nl:/home/shared ~/disks/Aeneas_Shared/ \
 -oauto_cache,reconnect,defer_permissions,noappledouble,negative_vncache,volname=shared &'
{% endhighlight %}

Then, if you want to unmount the server's disks:

{% highlight bash %}
alias ua_home='umount ~/disks/Aeneas_Home'
{% endhighlight %}

##### sshfs from Linux


{% highlight bash %}
alias aeneas_home='sshfs -p 22 $USER@aeneas.psy.vu.nl:/home/$USER ~/disks/Aeneas_Home/ -o idmap=user,auto_cache,reconnect &'
{% endhighlight %}

As for Mac OS X, this line can be duplicated for several other folders on the server, most importantly the `/home/shared/` folder, mounted at `~/disks/Aeneas_Shared/`. 

{% highlight bash %}
alias aeneas_shared='sshfs -p 22 $USER@aeneas.psy.vu.nl:/home/fs_subjects ~/disks/Aeneas_Subjects -o idmap=user,auto_cache,reconnect &'
{% endhighlight %}

Then, if you want to unmount the server's disks:

{% highlight bash %}
alias ua_home='fusermount -u ~/disks/Aeneas_Home'
{% endhighlight %}
