Daan received his Master's from the University of Amsterdam, with honours. During his Master's he performed EEG and fMRI experiments, focusing on time-frequency mechanisms of cross-modal integration and retinotopic analysis of experiments on synesthesia. 

These days, Daan works on how the brain changes its representation of visual space under the influence of attention.
