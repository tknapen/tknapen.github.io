Martijn did his Master's in Cognitive Artificial Intelligence at Utrecht University, after which he did a PhD with Bas Rokers and Serge Dumoulin in Wisconsin and Utrecht. His PhD work is on binocular processing in the human visual system, researched using the population receptive field mapping method. 

Martijn will be working on our ABMP project, in which he will using forward models of visual representations based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Gabor Wavelet Pyramids. With these models, he will investigate how representations of visual information change with changing tasks, expectations and attentional demands.
