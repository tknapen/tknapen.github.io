Visual information that enters the brain is inherently ambiguous. This makes seeing a process in which it is essential to make decisions about what to perceive from this ambiguous stream of information - for example using information from the past to predict what will appear.

Bistable perception takes this to another level. It boosts the ambiguity inherent in all vision, by constraining the interpretations possible from a single input to (usually) two interpretations. These interpretations are mutually exclusive, however, meaning that only one will be perceived at each point in time. This first perceptual state doesn't last indefinitely but will switch to perceptual dominance of the other interpretation, leading to a back-and-forth between perceptual states with the input being continually constant. The cool thing is, that when you undergo a change in perceptual state, you witness a change in the state of your visual brain in a more direct manner than at almost any other occasion ever.

# History of Bistable Perception Research
<br />
Since the 19th century, scientific discussions have centered around the type of brain activity that 'does' bistable perception. Some researchers, starting with Hermann von Helmholtz, thought of changes of perception in bistability as a process strongly related to changes of attention. Another school of thought, started by Ewald Hering, conceptualised bistable perception more in terms of a simple, mechanistic process that transpires more-or-less automatically. This debate still goes on, and research from our lab plays a role in this debate. 

With the advent of fMRI researchers could suddenly look into participants' brains while they were experiencing bistable perception. <img class="col one right" src="/img/publications/bistable_brain.png"> Letting their participants press a button whenever they saw a transition, and also created an experimental situation in which transitions were 'replayed' on the screen with the same instruction to the participants. Contrasting brain activations between these two situations, they thought, would show the brain mechanisms engaged in the endogenous changes of perception in bistability, over and above those engaged in exogenous visual changes. They found that frontal and parietal regions in the right side of the brain were specifically activated during 'real' vs 'fake' perceptual switches, like in the figure, right.

<br />But what are these transition-related activations? Our lab has been involved in trying to tease apart the functional role of these activations. In these attempts, we have been guided by the impression that perceptual switches in bistability are complex cognitive phenomena involving task-switching, arousal etc. - and that it is really hard to make an on-screen 'switch' resemble an endogenously generated one in exactly these cognitive parameters. For instance, it is impossible to create a replay switch that can be mistaken for an endogenous switch.
