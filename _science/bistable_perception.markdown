Visual information that enters the brain is inherently ambiguous. This makes seeing a process in which it is essential to make decisions about what to perceive from this ambiguous stream of information - for example using information from the past to predict what will appear.

Bistable perception takes this to another level. It boosts the ambiguity inherent in all vision, by constraining the interpretations possible from a single input to (usually) two interpretations. These interpretations are mutually exclusive, however, meaning that only one will be perceived at each point in time. This first perceptual state doesn't last indefinitely but will switch to perceptual dominance of the other interpretation, leading to a back-and-forth between perceptual states with the input being continually constant. The cool thing is, that when you undergo a change in perceptual state, you witness a change in the state of your visual brain in a more direct manner than at almost any other occasion ever.
